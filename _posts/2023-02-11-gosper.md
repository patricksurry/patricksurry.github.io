Amit Patel's great [hexagonal grid reference][hexref] links an interesting
stackoverflow question about [spiral honeycomb mosaic (SHM) coordinates][shmq].
This is a nice system for enumerating an infinite hex grid with a base-7
counting system.
We start at the origin and label its six immediate neighbors to form a super-hex
of seven individual hexagons.
We repeat the process to enumerate the six neighboring super-hexes,
making a super-super-hex of 7*7 = 49 individual hexagons,
and so on recursively.   (To infinity and beyond!)
In the posted solutions, Patel offers a nice approach for directly calculating the
index along the path for an arbitrary hexagon which we'll come back to shortly.

_Sprial honeycomb mosaic (SHM) coordinates give a recursive enumeration of an infinite grid in base 7 (black numbers).  Patel's mapping to axial coordiates is shown with red digits._

This enumeration of the grid is straightforward,
but if we draw the path connecting sequential numbers
it gets a little tangled.
I wondered if there was a more compact approach where the
path had few (or no) crossovers, and hexes with similar indices
on the path were likely to be closer together.
There are a bunch of examples of such [space-filling curves][sfc] on the
normal Cartesian lattice including the [Hilbert curve][hilbert]
which is more compact than the more common [z-order curve][zorder].

While exploring the Cartesian analogs, I came across the [Gosper curve][gosperwiki].
It has a hexagonal vibe but the repeating seven segment unit doesn't
immediately look like it maps nicely to a super hex.

![Gosper curve motif](/assets/img/gosper-motif.jpg){: width="600px" }
_The Gosper curve is formed by a recurring motif of seven directed line segments ([source][newgosper])_

But it turns out there's a nice dual of the curve where each directed segment
maps to a hexagon to give the [flowsnake][flowsnake].

_The flowsnake is a dual view of the Gosper curve formed by a recurring motif of seven hexagons ([source][flowsnake])_

Now we can form the same recuring pattern for labeling hex, super hexes,
super-super hexes and so on.
Here's a [hand-drawn sketch][gdraw] I put together to get to grips with the
recurrence.
It seems obvious that we should be able to enumerate the points on the flowsnake
in a one-to-one correspondence to the SHM enumeration but how exactly?
One key difference is that the flowsnake path always has two finite ends,
whereas the SHM labeling that starts at the origin and extends
outward to infinity.

![Gosper recurrence](/assets/img/gosper-recur.jpg){: width="400px" }
_We can recursively trace a path through super-hex groupings of a central hex and their six neighbors. The seven hex motif is traced by red segments, with seven of these super-hexes connected by blue segments to form a self-similar super-super-hex motif sketched in green.  Seven of these are connected with yellow segments to form another self-similar grouping and so on forever._

[TODO add super-hex shading and both coords to the gosper example]
